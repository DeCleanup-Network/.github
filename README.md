# DeCleanup Network Litepaper
**Version 2.2 – November 2025**

---

## Overview

DeCleanup Network is global infrastructure for coordinating environmental cleanups and converting them into permanent, blockchain-verified impact. We connect individuals, grassroots groups, and organizations into a shared ecosystem where every cleanup becomes an onchain **Impact Product**.

**Live V1 dApp:** [dapp.decleanup.net](https://dapp.decleanup.net)

---

## Mission

Transform cleanups into measurable, blockchain-verified environmental commodities—**Impact Products**—through transparent verification, community governance, and scalable incentive models.

---

## The Problem

- No lasting incentives for cleanup action
- No standardized way to quantify and prove environmental contribution
- Isolated local efforts with no shared infrastructure

## Our Solution

**Tokenizing Impact into Impact Products**  
Each cleanup becomes a dynamic onchain Impact Product—a verifiable, growing asset tied to real-world action.

**Hypercerts Integration**  
Every 10 verified cleanups generates a permanent blockchain certificate (ERC-1155) aggregating cumulative impact data, portable across Web3 ecosystems.

**Community Verification**  
Decentralized validation through staked verifiers ensures scalability and legitimacy.

**Global Network**  
Ambassador program and decentralized technology connect local cleanup efforts into one shared ecosystem.

---

## How It Works

### 3-Step Process

1. **Clean Up** – Find pollution in your area or join existing cleanup
2. **Snap** – Capture before/after photos with GPS geotags and timestamps
3. **Earn** – Submit via dApp, get verified, receive Impact Product + $DCU

### Documenting a Cleanup

- Locate area needing cleanup
- Enable geolocation and timestamps
- Take clear "before" photos
- Clean thoroughly
- Capture "after" photos from same positions

### Submitting Proof of Impact

1. Visit [app.decleanup.net](https://app.decleanup.net)
2. Connect wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
3. Click "Submit Cleanup"
4. Upload before/after photos with geotags
5. **Optional:** Fill detailed impact form (waste type, weight, area, duration)
6. Wait for verification (2-24 hours)
7. Claim Impact Product and $DCU

### Enhanced Impact Data Collection

Optional detailed metrics during submission:
- Waste types (plastic, metal, organic, glass, etc.)
- Weight removed (kg)
- Area cleaned (m²)
- Duration (minutes)
- Environmental context (beach, park, waterway, forest)
- Before/after condition ratings

This data contributes to SDG 11 and SDG 13 measurement and generates **Hypercerts** after every 10 cleanups.

---

## Verification System

### Current (V2.1): Team + Community Hybrid

Team reviews submissions for geotag authenticity, timestamp verification, photo quality, and cleanup evidence.

### Upcoming (V2.2): Decentralized Community Verification

**Becoming a Verifier:**
- Stake 100 $DCU minimum
- Lock tokens for chosen duration
- Access verification queue
- Earn 1 $DCU per validated submission

**Process:**
- Submissions enter queue visible to staked verifiers
- Verifiers review and vote approve/reject
- Passes with 3+ approvals or 100+ $DCU vote weight
- Accurate verifiers earn rewards; false verifications penalized

**Anti-Fraud:**
- Stake-at-risk model
- Multiple verifier consensus
- Historical accuracy tracking
- Community appeals process

---

## Impact Products

Tokenized Real World Impact (RWI) as onchain commodities using dynamic NFT technology.

### Characteristics

- **Soulbound:** Non-transferable
- **Dynamic:** Metadata updates automatically
- **Verifiable:** Onchain proof of contributions
- **Evolving:** Grows with cleanup history

### Metadata

**Constant Traits:**
- Type: DeCleanup Impact Product
- Impact: Environmental
- Category: Tokenized Cleanups

**Dynamic Traits:**
- Impact Value (1-10+)
- Level (Newbie → Pro → Hero → Guardian)
- Cleanups Completed
- Hypercerts Earned

### Level Progression

| Cleanups | Impact Value | Level    |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1-3      | 1-3          | Newbie   |
| 4-6      | 4-6          | Pro      |
| 7-9      | 7-9          | Hero     |
| 10+      | 10+          | Guardian |

### Claiming

After verification (2-24 hours), manually claim Impact Product. Metadata updates dynamically with increased Impact Value and level progression.

**Future:** Stakeable in Regen Bazaar to earn $REBAZ tokens.
