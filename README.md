# üåç DeCleanup Network ‚Äì Empowering Cleanups. Tokenizing Impact.

## üß≠ Mission
We mobilize people worldwide to take meaningful environmental action by transforming cleanups into measurable, onchain environmental commodities - called Impact Products. Through transparent verification, community participation, and scalable incentive models, we drive real-world impact that bridges local actions with global significance.

---

## üîó What is DeCleanup Network?
DeCleanup Network is a global system for coordinating environmental cleanups and turning them into long-lasting digital impact. It connects individuals, grassroots groups, and partner organizations into a shared ecosystem, where every cleanup becomes part of a broader effort to regenerate the planet. By converting actions into onchain dynamic Impact Products, we enable recognition, traceability, and participation across regions and communities.
Additionally, users are being rewarded with $DCU - an in-app currency that will be redeemable for a token post-TGE. 
DeCleanup Impact Products will be later integrated to impact marketplace - [Regen Bazaar](https://regenbazaar.com), allowing participants to earn additional rewards for staking them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem & Our Solution

### The Challenges
- Lack of Incentives for Cleanup Action
- Limited Recognition and Quantification of Personal Impact
- Weak Global Coordination

### Our Solution
- Tokenizing Impact into Impact Products: we turn each cleanup into a dynamic onchain Impact Product - a visible, growing asset tied to real-world action. This creates lasting value and recognition beyond the moment of cleanup.
- Scalable Personal Recognition System: participants earn visibility and status through a system designed to reflect their actual environmental contributions - unlocking new levels, metrics, and future benefits based on their actions.
- Global Network of Coordinated Action: through our ambassador program, partner communities, and decentralized tech, we connect local cleanup efforts into one shared ecosystem - aligned, visible, and scalable across borders.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Clean Up, Snap, Earn (3-Step Process)
1. **Clean Up** ‚Äì Find or organize a cleanup in your local area.  
2. **Snap** ‚Äì Capture before-and-after photos with geotags and timestamps.  
3. **Earn** ‚Äì Submit via the dApp, get verified, receive DeCleanup Impact Products, and accumulate $DCU rewards.

## ‚úÖ Existing Use Cases (V1 Campaigns)

### üáØüáµ HEM Japan
HEM Japan was DeCleanup‚Äôs first active community partner. Led by Yuichi Hosomo (the first user to complete all Impact Product levels), they‚Äôve demonstrated the power of Web3 for real-world environmental action.  
- **2024 Impact**: 12 active users, 9 cleanup events registered.

### üá≥üá¨ Pesathon (Nigeria) ‚Äì UNNploggas Youth Campaign
Pesathon campaign brought together cleanup and environmental education in Nigerian schools and communities, they partnered with DeCleanup Network, submitting cleanups via [dApp V1](https://decleanup.net). We also provided additional sponsorship for the participants in $USDGLO, which then were sent to the most active participants via [Atlantis Impact Miner](https://www.atlantisp2p.com/).   
- **2024 Impact**: 9 users, 4 verified events

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap ‚Äì Building a Scalable, Verifiable Cleanup Ecosystem

### üîÑ Current Development: DeCleanup dApp V2.1
Version 2.1 lays the technical and experiential groundwork for DeCleanup‚Äôs long-term ecosystem. It introduces the core mechanics that bring environmental action on-chain while setting up for EVM compatibility and eventual decentralization.

### üîë Key Features of V2.1

#### üßæ Proof of Impact System
A secure and transparent flow that verifies real-world cleanup efforts using visual and geolocation data.

- **Required Submission**:  
  - Before & after photos of the cleaned location.  
  - Geotagged and timestamped image files (JPEG, JPG, HEIC, max 10MB per image).  
  - Optional consent, allowing us to use images provided on our socials.

- **Team-Based Verification Flow**:  
  - Submissions are manually reviewed by the DeCleanup team.  
  - Must show clear before/after difference, consistent framing, and real-world metadata.  
  - AI-generated or manipulated images, or any unverifiable submissions, are rejected.  
  - Review time: 2‚Äì12 hours depending on volume.

- **Post-Verification Actions**:  
  - Once approved, users receive access to ‚ÄúClaim Next Level.‚Äù  
  - Claiming generates a DeCleanup Impact Product (gas fees apply).

#### üß© DeCleanup Impact Products
These are soulbound dynamic NFTs that represent tokenized environmental contributions.  
- Non-transferable, tied to the wallet of the person who cleaned up.  
- Represent Real World Impact (RWI) and evolve based on verified activity.  
- Automatically update onchain metadata: level progression, streaks, and total Impact Value.  
- Serve as future gateways to additional utility (e.g., staking on Regen Bazaar for APY in native token).

#### üí∞ $DCU Accumulation System
Users earn $DCU (initially non-tradable system points) for every verified cleanup.  
- Bonus rewards for activity streaks and verified referral actions.  
- $DCU can be redeemed into actual tokens post-TGE.

---

## üß≠ Upcoming Roadmap

### üîú V2.2
- $DCU token launch: utility first.
- Community validation for Proof of Impact: users can become verifiers by staking and locking their $DCU.
- Impact Circles: collaborative cleanup campaigns where multiple users contribute to a shared environmental impact initiative.
- Multichain expansion: multiple EVM-compatible chains, plus Stellar.
- Start of Regen Bazaar integration - users will be able to stake their DeCleanup Impact Products at Regen Bazaar to earn $REBAZ tokens, introducing DeFi-powered incentives for impact-based staking. 

## Overview

The **DeCleanup dApp V2.2** focuses on **Impact Circles** ‚Äì collaborative, time-bound, and location-based cleanup campaigns. Users can **create** or **join** campaigns through the platform. Each Impact Circle can include a reward pool and concludes with a **campaign NFT** minted upon completion.

### üî≠ V2.3 ‚Äì Cleanup Campaigns, Teams & Impact Circles
- Multi-chain POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) - non-transferable ERC-721 NFTs, issued to users who participate in verified Impact Circles across different blockchains, they act as verifiable, on-chain proof of environmental contribution and may hold future staking, reputation, or governance utilities, offering enhanced recognition for sustained contributions.  
- Expanded reward system - introduction of additional tiers of Impact Product to recognize long-term commitment and larger contributions.  
- Impact metrics expansion - detailed tracking and differentiation of Impact Value, based on various environmental factors (e.g., type of waste removed, cleanup location significance, CO2 offset calculations). 
- Governance mechanics - users who staked $DCU will be able to vote on key DeCleanup Network decisions, such as adjusting staking APY and verification rewards, deciding on grant funding for large-scale cleanup campaigns, proposing and implementing new reward mechanism or token utilities. 
- Ambassador program & incentives - selected community leaders and contributors can earn extra $DCU rewards for promoting DeCleanup, onboarding new participants, and organizing cleanup events.
