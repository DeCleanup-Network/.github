# 🌍 DeCleanup Network – Empowering Cleanups. Tokenizing Impact.

## 🧭 Mission
DeCleanup Network motivates people worldwide to take meaningful action for the environment by ensuring that every cleanup is recognized, measurable, and rewarded. Through proof-based verification, gamified participation, and Web3 incentives, we drive transparent, real-world impact that scales from local communities to a global movement.

## 🔗 What is DeCleanup Network?
DeCleanup Network represents individuals and communities taking environmental action into their own hands and self-tokenizing their impact. Through our web3-powered dApp, users can document cleanups, verify their impact onchain, and earn DeCleanup Impact Product - tokenized Real World Impact, representing verifiable environmental action and dynamically growing in levels with each new cleanup submitted. Additionally, users are being rewarded with $DCU - an in-app currency that will be redeemable for a token post-TGE. 
DeCleanup Impact Products will be later integrated to impact marketplace - [Regen Bazaar](https://regenbazaar.com), allowing participants to earn additional rewards for staking them.

## ⚠️ The Problem & Our Solution

### The Challenges
- **Massive Environmental Pollution** – Over 2 billion tons of waste are generated globally each year, much of it ending up in oceans, forests, and cities, harming ecosystems and communities.
- **Unrecognized Cleanup Efforts** – People and organizations take action, but their contributions often go unnoticed, offering no lasting accountability or motivation.
- **No Scalable System** – There is no way to track, measure, or verify real-world cleanup efforts at scale.
- **Lack of Transparency** – Without proof, it is difficult to validate real environmental impact, discouraging long-term participation.

### Our Solution
DeCleanup solves these by connecting Web3 infrastructure to Real World Impact of cleanups:

- **Tokenized Environmental Action**: Every verified cleanup becomes an onchain dynamic DeCleanup Impact Product, tied to Impact Value parameter and growing in levels with every submission.   
- **Verifiable Proof of Impact**: Submissions are validated through photos, timestamps, and geolocation, then stored permanently.  
- **Gamified Rewards**: Users earn $DCU for every verified cleanup and level up through streaks and participation bonuses, checking your rank at the leaderboard.  
- **Transition to Real Value**: $DCU, earned as system points, will be redeemable as tokens post-TGE, giving contributors long-term stake in the network.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Clean Up, Snap, Earn (3-Step Process)
1. **Clean Up** – Find or organize a cleanup in your local area.  
2. **Snap** – Capture before-and-after photos with geotags and timestamps.  
3. **Earn** – Submit via the dApp, get verified, receive DeCleanup Impact Products, and accumulate $DCU rewards.

## ✅ Existing Use Cases (V1 Campaigns)

### 🇯🇵 HEM Japan
HEM Japan was DeCleanup’s first active community partner. Led by Yuichi Hosomo (the first user to complete all Impact Product levels), they’ve demonstrated the power of Web3 for real-world environmental action.  
- **2024 Impact**: 12 active users, 9 cleanup events registered.

### 🇳🇬 Pesathon (Nigeria) – UNNploggas Youth Campaign
Pesathon campaign brought together cleanup and environmental education in Nigerian schools and communities, they partnered with DeCleanup Network, submitting cleanups via [dApp V1](https://decleanup.net). We also provided additional sponsorship for the participants in $USDGLO, which then were sent to the most active participants via [Atlantis Impact Miner](https://www.atlantisp2p.com/).   
- **2024 Impact**: 9 users, 4 verified events

## 🛣️ Roadmap – Building a Scalable, Verifiable Cleanup Ecosystem

### 🔄 Current Development: DeCleanup dApp V2.1
Version 2.1 lays the technical and experiential groundwork for DeCleanup’s long-term ecosystem. It introduces the core mechanics that bring environmental action on-chain while setting up for EVM compatibility and eventual decentralization.

### 🔑 Key Features of V2.1

#### 🧾 Proof of Impact System
A secure and transparent flow that verifies real-world cleanup efforts using visual and geolocation data.

- **Required Submission**:  
  - Before & after photos of the cleaned location.  
  - Geotagged and timestamped image files (JPEG, JPG, HEIC, max 10MB per image).  
  - Optional consent, allowing us to use images provided on our socials.

- **Team-Based Verification Flow**:  
  - Submissions are manually reviewed by the DeCleanup team.  
  - Must show clear before/after difference, consistent framing, and real-world metadata.  
  - AI-generated or manipulated images, or any unverifiable submissions, are rejected.  
  - Review time: 2–12 hours depending on volume.

- **Post-Verification Actions**:  
  - Once approved, users receive access to “Claim Next Level.”  
  - Claiming generates a DeCleanup Impact Product (gas fees apply).

#### 🧩 DeCleanup Impact Products
These are soulbound dynamic NFTs that represent tokenized environmental contributions.  
- Non-transferable, tied to the wallet of the person who cleaned up.  
- Represent Real World Impact (RWI) and evolve based on verified activity.  
- Automatically update onchain metadata: level progression, streaks, and total Impact Value.  
- Serve as future gateways to additional utility (e.g., staking on Regen Bazaar for APY in native token).

#### 💰 $DCU Accumulation System
Users earn $DCU (initially non-tradable system points) for every verified cleanup.  
- Bonus rewards for activity streaks and verified referral actions.  
- $DCU can be redeemed into actual tokens post-TGE.

## 🧭 Upcoming Roadmap

### 🔜 V2.2
- $DCU token launch: utility first.
- Community validation for Proof of Impact: users can become verifiers by staking and locking their $DCU.
- Impact Circles: collaborative cleanup campaigns where multiple users contribute to a shared environmental impact initiative.
- Multichain expansion: multiple EVM-compatible chains, plus Stellar.
- Start of Regen Bazaar integration - users will be able to stake their DeCleanup Impact Products at Regen Bazaar to earn $REBAZ tokens, introducing DeFi-powered incentives for impact-based staking. 

### 🔭 V2.3 – Cleanup Campaigns, Teams & Impact Circles
- Multi-chain POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) - non-transferable ERC-721 NFTs, issued to users who participate in verified Impact Circles across different blockchains, they act as verifiable, on-chain proof of environmental contribution and may hold future staking, reputation, or governance utilities, offering enhanced recognition for sustained contributions.  
- Expanded reward system - introduction of additional tiers of Impact Product to recognize long-term commitment and larger contributions.  
- Impact metrics expansion - detailed tracking and differentiation of Impact Value, based on various environmental factors (e.g., type of waste removed, cleanup location significance, CO2 offset calculations). 
- Governance mechanics - users who staked $DCU will be able to vote on key DeCleanup Network decisions, such as adjusting staking APY and verification rewards, deciding on grant funding for large-scale cleanup campaigns, proposing and implementing new reward mechanism or token utilities. 
- Ambassador program & incentives - selected community leaders and contributors can earn extra $DCU rewards for promoting DeCleanup, onboarding new participants, and organizing cleanup events.
