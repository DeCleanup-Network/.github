# DeCleanup Network Litepaper
Version 2.1 – June 2025
---

## What is DeCleanup Network?
DeCleanup Network is a global system for coordinating environmental cleanups and turning them into long-lasting digital impact. It connects individuals, grassroots groups, and partner organizations into a shared ecosystem, where every cleanup becomes part of a broader effort to regenerate the planet. By converting actions into onchain dynamic Impact Products, we enable recognition, traceability, and participation across regions and communities.

---

## Mission
We mobilize people worldwide to take meaningful environmental action by transforming cleanups into measurable, onchain environmental commodities - called Impact Products. Through transparent verification, community participation, and scalable incentive models, we drive real-world impact that bridges local actions with global significance.

---

## The Problem & Our Solution
### The Challenges
- Lack of Incentives for Cleanup Action
- Limited Recognition and Quantification of Personal Impact
- Weak Global Coordination

### Our Solution
- Tokenizing Impact into Impact Products: we turn each cleanup into a dynamic onchain Impact Product - a visible, growing asset tied to real-world action. This creates lasting value and recognition beyond the moment of cleanup.
- Scalable Personal Recognition System: participants earn visibility and status through a system designed to reflect their actual environmental contributions - unlocking new levels, metrics, and future benefits based on their actions.
- Global Network of Coordinated Action: through our ambassador program, partner communities, and decentralized tech, we connect local cleanup efforts into one shared ecosystem - aligned, visible, and scalable across borders.

## What is a DeCleanup Impact Product?
**DeCleanup Impact Products** are tokenized **Real World Impact (RWI)** in the form of on-chain commodities, utilizing **dynamic NFT technology**.
They are **soulbound assets** that serve as **verifiable proof of environmental contributions** within the DeCleanup ecosystem. Each Impact Product represents a user’s cleanup impact and **evolves** as they complete more cleanups.
These NFTs **upgrade dynamically** based on a user’s cleanup history, encouraging **long-term participation in sustainability efforts**. They also hold **on-chain metadata** that updates automatically, such as level progression and Impact Value.

### Metadata Structure
**Collection Description:**  
_DeCleanup Impact Product with future staking utility, tokenizing environmental cleanup efforts._

**Constant Traits**
- **Type:** DeCleanup Impact Product  
- **Impact:** Environmental  
- **Category:** Tokenized Cleanups  

**Dynamic Traits**
- **Impact Value:** A measurable score representing the real-world impact of each cleanup. Varies based on level (e.g., 1 for Newbie, 10 for Guardian).
- **Level:** User progression reflected dynamically (e.g., Newbie, Pro, Hero, Guardian).

### Levels Progression
| Cleanups Required | Impact Value | Level    |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| 1                 | 1            | Newbie   |
| 2                 | 2            | Newbie   |
| 3                 | 3            | Newbie   |
| 4                 | 4            | Pro      |
| 5                 | 5            | Pro      |
| 6                 | 6            | Pro      |
| 7                 | 7            | Hero     |
| 8                 | 8            | Hero     |
| 9                 | 9            | Hero     |
| 10                | 10           | Guardian |

### Claiming Process
Users must **manually claim** their DeCleanup Impact Product after their cleanup submission is successfully **verified**.  
The verification process typically takes **2 to 12 hours**.
Upon claiming:
- The asset’s **metadata updates dynamically**, reflecting:
  - Increased **Impact Value**

## Reward System
**$DCU** is the reward for participation in the DeCleanup ecosystem. It is first accumulated as **DCU Points** (for progress tracking) and will become **claimable as $DCU tokens** after the Token Generation Event (TGE), unlocking further utilities.

### Ways to Earn $DCU

**Through Claiming DeCleanup Impact Product**
- Each successful cleanup submission that passes verification and leads to a claim of **any level** earns **10 $DCU**.

**Streak Bonuses**
- Users who submit and verify at least **1 cleanup every 7 days** receive a **+3 $DCU bonus** with their DeCleanup Impact Product level claim.

**Referral Bonuses**
- Invite friends using a **referral link**.
- When the referred user submits and verifies their **first cleanup** and mints their Impact Product, the **referrer earns +1 $DCU**.

### Conversion to $DCU
- The **Token Generation Event (TGE)** will convert all **DCU Points into $DCU tokens** at a **1:1 ratio**.
- This ensures a **fair, impact-driven token distribution**, avoiding early speculative trading.
- After TGE, users can **claim their $DCU** directly from a **dedicated claim page** in the dApp.

### Future Utilities of $DCU
**Staking for APY Rewards**
- Stake $DCU to earn **passive yield**.
- Higher **staking tiers** may unlock **multipliers** based on lock-up duration.

**Verifier Role Access & Governance**
- Locking $DCU grants access to **verification roles**.
- Validators will:
  - Review Proof-of-Impact (PoI) submissions  
  - Vote on approval or rejection
- Future **decentralized governance** features will let $DCU holders vote on:
  - Reward structures  
  - Cleanup fund allocations  
  - Community grants  

**Multi-Chain Expansion & Liquidity**
- $DCU will expand to ecosystems like:
  - **Superchain Eco**
  - **Polygon zkEVM**
  - **Stellar** *(potentially)*
  - **Supra** *(potentially)*
- Plans include:
  - **Liquidity pools** on decentralized exchanges (DEXes)
  - **Interoperability** with other sustainability tokens

## Upcoming Roadmap
### Current Development: DeCleanup dApp V2.1
Version 2.1 lays the technical and experiential groundwork for DeCleanup’s long-term ecosystem. It introduces the core mechanics that bring environmental action on-chain while setting up for EVM compatibility and eventual decentralization.

![Roadmap](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreiena6xdo4gzdtraxxnov6lwz5tyak4dxkmtynf2ndvc4c7ek6x22m)

### V2.2
- $DCU token launch: utility first.
- Community validation for Proof of Impact: users can become verifiers by staking and locking their $DCU.
- Impact Circles: collaborative cleanup campaigns where multiple users contribute to a shared environmental impact initiative.
- Multichain expansion: multiple EVM-compatible chains, plus Stellar.
- Start of Regen Bazaar integration - users will be able to stake their DeCleanup Impact Products at Regen Bazaar to earn $REBAZ tokens, introducing DeFi-powered incentives for impact-based staking. 

### V2.3
- Multi-chain POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) - non-transferable ERC-721 NFTs, issued to users who participate in verified Impact Circles across different blockchains, they act as verifiable, on-chain proof of environmental contribution and may hold future staking, reputation, or governance utilities, offering enhanced recognition for sustained contributions.  
- Expanded reward system - introduction of additional tiers of Impact Product to recognize long-term commitment and larger contributions.  
- Impact metrics expansion - detailed tracking and differentiation of Impact Value, based on various environmental factors (e.g., type of waste removed, cleanup location significance, CO2 offset calculations). 
- Governance mechanics - users who staked $DCU will be able to vote on key DeCleanup Network decisions, such as adjusting staking APY and verification rewards, deciding on grant funding for large-scale cleanup campaigns, proposing and implementing new reward mechanism or token utilities. 
- Ambassador program & incentives - selected community leaders and contributors can earn extra $DCU rewards for promoting DeCleanup, onboarding new participants, and organizing cleanup events.
